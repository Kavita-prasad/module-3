        <h3 class="text-center">Paneer</h3>
        <p>Paneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the
		Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with
		either spinach (palak paneer) or peas (mattar paneer). Paneer is used in main dishes
        as well as desserts and snacks.
       The well-known rasgulla features plain chhana beaten by hand and shaped into balls which are 
       boiled in syrup. The sana / chhana / chhena used in such cases is manufactured by a slightly
       different procedure from paneer; it is drained but not pressed, so that some moisture is retained,
       which makes for a soft, malleable consistency. It may, however,
       be pressed slightly into small cubes and curried to form a dalna in Maithili, Oriya and Bengali cuisines.
		Some paneer recipes include

        Paneer pulao (paneer with rice)
        Mattar paneer (paneer with peas)
        Shahi paneer (paneer cooked in a rich Mughlai curry)
        Paneer tikka (a vegetarian version of chicken tikka, paneer placed on skewers and roasted)
        Paneer tikka masala
        Chili paneer (an Indo-Chinese preparation with spicy chilies, onions and green peppers, usually served dry and garnished with spring onions)
        Paneer pakora (paneer fritters)
        Palak paneer
          Ras malai
          Rasgulla
         Paneer momo
         Kadai paneer
		  a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and

		  texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar
		  method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer
		  cheese (pressed cottage cheese) and firm versions of quark are similar except 
		  that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many Indians

		  translate "paneer" into "cottage cheese", cottage cheese may be made using

		  rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants and such varieties when pressed 
		  into farmer cheese are firmer than paneer. Queso blanco or queso fresco are 
		  often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more 
		  commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, 
		  as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature.
		  Both are generally salted, unlike paneer.
		  It is also similar to unsalted halloumi.

        <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
		
		Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
		Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in 
		
		comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become 
		prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and 
		their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

       Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling,
       barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose.
       Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple 
 
       of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat,
       with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.

       The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range
	   of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are 
	   typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise 
	   chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates
	   there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
        <p>Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically
		for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced
		by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.[13]

        Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are
        typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.

        Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered
         a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.
		Other
Chicken feet: These contain relatively little meat, and are eaten mainly for the skin and cartilage.
 Although considered exotic in Western cuisine, the feet are common fare in other cuisines, especially 
 in the Caribbean and China.
Giblets: organs such as the heart, gizzards, and liver may be included inside a butchered chicken or 
sold separately.
Head: Considered a delicacy in China, the head is split down the middle, and the brains and other
 tissue is eaten.
Kidneys: Normally left in when a broiler carcass is processed, they are found in deep pockets on
 each side of the vertebral column.
Neck: This is served in various Asian dishes. It is stuffed to make helzel among Ashkenazi Jews.
Oysters: Located on the back, near the thigh, these small, round pieces of dark meat are often
 considered to be a delicacy.[15]
Pygostyle (chicken's buttocks) and testicles: These are commonly eaten in East Asia and some parts
 of South East Asia.
By-products
Blood: Immediately after slaughter, blood may be drained into a receptacle, which is then used in 
various products. In many Asian countries, the blood is poured into low, cylindrical forms, and left to congeal into disc-like cakes for sale. These are commonly cut into cubes, and used in soup dishes.
Carcass: After the removal of the flesh, this is used for soup stock.
Chicken eggs: The most well-known and well-consumed byproduct.
Heart and gizzard: in Brazilian churrascos, chicken hearts are an often seen as a delicacy.
Liver: This is the largest organ of the chicken, and is used in such dishes as Pâté and chopped liver.
Schmaltz: This is produced by rendering the fat, and is used in various dishes.

        <h3 class="text-center">Mashroom  chilli</h3>
        <p>A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body
		of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source.

The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom,
 Agaricus bisporus; hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota,
 Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella)
 on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi,
 with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies 
 
 of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across
 the ground or its occupant surface.

Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names,
 such as "bolete", "puffball", "stinkhorn", and "morel", and gilled mushrooms 
 themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus
 or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term "mushroom" can also refer to either
 the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called a mycelium) of species forming
 the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.
	The terms "mushroom" and "toadstool" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns were used.[2]

The term "mushroom" and its variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron 
in reference to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut,
 so a "mushroom" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.

Cultural or social phobias of mushrooms and fungi may be related. The term "fungophobia" was
 coined by William Delisle Hay of England, who noted a national superstition or fear of "toadstools".

The word "toadstool" has apparent analogies in Dutch padde(n)stoel (toad-stool/chair, mushroom)
 and German Krötenschwamm (toad-fungus, alt. word for panther cap). In German folklore and old fairy tales,
 toads are often depicted sitting on toadstool mushrooms and catching, with their tongues, the flies that
 are said to be drawn to the Fliegenpilz, a German name for the toadstool, meaning "flies' mushroom". This
 is how the mushroom got another of its names, Krötenstuhl (a less-used German name for the mushroom),
 literally translating to "toad-stool".
